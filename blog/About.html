        <h2>Brayden Drummond</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my blog! I am a graduate of the University of Canterbury with a Bachelor of Laws. I recently worked at the Waitangi Tribunal as part of the Registry team, 
          primarily helping Māori to have their grievances against the Crown heard before the Tribunal. During my time with the Tribunal I assisted on many
          inquiries, including into the Crown's COVID-19 vaccination policy and decision to move to a traffic-light setting approach and the Deed of Mandate into
          the historical claims of Te Whakatōhea.</p>
        <p>I have always been interested in tech and development, and have dabbled in coding here and there. I recently decided to take the plunge and try my
            luck in transitioning into the tech industry. I am currently studying and developing my programming and coding 
            with <a href="https://devacademy.co.nz/">Dev Academy</a> and am looking forward to seeing myself grow.</p>
        <p>In my spare time, I love to play video games, watch movies, listen to music, play golf and hang with friends. I am also a 7-time National champion and 
        4-time World finalist with the Canterbury Caledonian Pipe Society.</p>
