        <h2>What are three new things I have learnt about myself and my ego due to the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          What I have learnt about myself and my ego is that I do not enjoy not knowing how to solve a problem right off the bat, I cann get flustered when I do not know how to solve an issue or where to start, however I do like to be challenged.
        </p>
        <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
        <p>
          Values defines who we are and how we carry our core values into our learning and programming journey. Empathy allows us to understand that we are not alone in this journey and that we can see how other people intepret the world and their surroundings. It allows us to have compassion for each other in our learning and programming journey. Self-awareness teaches us to not be too critical of ourselves, and that we are all learning at our own individual pace.
        </p>
        <h2>What has surprised me the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          What has surprised me the most is how much I have developed my self-critical thinking over the past 5 weeks. I have really enjoyed learning all the content, especially around my ego and also trying to interpret a growth mindset.
        </p>
        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          The most challenging part has been putting the concepts I have learnt into practice. I will need to continue to practice moving forward to get stronger at these core concepts.
        </p>
        <h2>Why do I think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
        <p>
          To prepare us not only for bootcamp, but for our future career in tech as it is a heavily based problem solving career. It teaches us to be resilient and allows us to understand how we are all growing and interrelate with each other. It also stresses how important it is to take breaks and to look after our mental and physical well-being
        </p>
        <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should I have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify my answer.</h2>
        <p>
          No I don't think so. As highlighted above, we need to be resilient if we are to succeed in the tech industry and this course teaches us the skills we need to do so.
