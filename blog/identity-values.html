      <h1>My Identity and Values</h1>
      <h4 class="timestamp"><em>- Posted 30 June 2022, Brayden Drummond</em></h4>

      <div>
        <h2>Core personal values</h2>
        <p>When I was in my final year at high school, one of my best mates told me that he was struggling to memorise the concepts and abswers to the multi-choice questions section of the economics test that we had coming up together. He told me that he was considering writing some of the answers on his leg so that he could refer back to them if he got stuck on any of the questions. The last thing I wanted was for him to get in trouble for doing this, but also the implications this may have on people who have studied hard for the test and wanted to do well legitimately. </p>
        <p>In this situation, I had to weigh up whether or not I should tell someone, and if so, who I should inform? I also had to weigh up values including integrity, honesty and responsibility against my loyalty to one of my best mates. In the end, I decided to inform his whanau of this in the hopes they would be able to talk him out of doing this. I didn't think it was necessary to inform the school of this because I knew he was close with his whānau, especially his older brother and the issue was not as severe as if he had actually cheated. In the end, his family was able to talk him out of doing so, which I think was the best outcome. The only consequence was that our friendship might have slightly deteriorated at the time, but we were back to being good mates within a couple of days because he knew I was only looking out for him.</p>
        <p>My culture has influenced my values and identity, especially in this decision as whānau is important.</p>

        <h2>Strengths and limitations</h2>
        <p>I am heavily motivated in learning new material and developing my career. I am kept motivated as I want to be in a career in the near future where I am contributing to the development of tech and Te Ao Māori.</p>
        <p>I am heavily goal orientated and am always looking for the next opportunity, my next steps in temrs of the goals I am trying to achieve and the best way to go about achieving this. Examples include completing my law degree and professional legal studies, and developing my te reo outside of study or working hours.</p>
        <p>In terms of limitations, sometimes I may take up too many opportunities and struggle to dedicate time to succeeding in these opportunities. I especially find it hard to develop a healthy work/study-life balance which has led to stress before. I am trying to realistically think aboiut the amount of time I should be dedicating to my development and practise efficient and effective time-management skills to help mitigate the stress I sometimes feel.</p>
        <p>Motivation will help me in my learning journey because as long as I am willing to succeed to the best of my ability, then I know I will be able to achieve all tasks which I encounter. Goal-setting will also aid me in my development because as long as I set goals at the start of each week and continue to monitor how I am tracking with achieving this goal throughout the week, then I should be on track to succeed. Goal-setting also has helped in the past manage my time effectively and will continue to do so as I am able to see how much time I need to dedicate each day to achieving whichever goal I have set.</p>
        <p>An example where I was trying to work productively with others, but where there was tension was when I had a mutual disagreemnent with my colleague about the legal advice we should be offering our seniors. The strategies we both used at the time included dropping our judgement of eachothers approaches, appreciating that the work we were doing was contributing to the betterment of Aotearoa, understanding the points of view for eachothers approaches, and ultimately having compassion for each other. These strategies were likely effective as we achieved the task to a high standard, but again we knew that the work we were doing was important so we just had to swallow our pride and co-operate on this mahi to ensure the best advice was given.</p>
        <p>What I would have done next time was discuss our disagreemnt more in-depth to try and negate any tension before we started this mahi. I would have also discussed a way in which we could both receive a reward at the completion of this work to motivate us further.</p>
