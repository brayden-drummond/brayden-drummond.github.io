        <h2><a id="JavaScript-shortcut">JavaScript, HTML and CSS</a></h2>
        <p>HTML is the platform for the building blocks of a webpage. It is used to create the basic website structure and content (such as text, images and videos) which can then be accessed and manipulated using CSS and JavaScript. CSS then adds styling to the structure and content that HTML brings (such as changing font colors, adding borders and changing the position of content). It is essentially the design of the web page and how we want to present our web page to the user.</p>
        <p>JavaScript relates to CSS and HTML as it is what we use if we want our webpage to perform tasks and how users can interact with our web page. A basic example would be to think about a website that has a basic calculator in it. This calculator would need the user to input numbers (the interactivity) and then when the user presses a button to calculate the outcome of these numbers, JavaScript perfroms a task to calculate these numbers and return it back to the user. An even more basic example would be a button which is displayed to a user, and when this button is clicked, it performs a task such as changing a colour on the page.</p>

        <h2><a id="Control-flow-and-loops-shortcut">Control flow and Loops</a></h2>
        <p>Control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. JavaScript uses control flow by reading lines of code from top to bottom, unless the computer encounters codes which changes the control flow. There are two main type of structures which may change the control flow, being conditionals or loops. An example of a condition statement is an if...else statement.</p>
        <p>Loops affect control flow and are used when we want the computer to perform a task that will be repeated based on a condition that we have set. There are many types of loops, however we will focus on for loops. There are 3 parts to the for loop, being initialization, condtion and the final expression.</p>
        <p>The initialization runs before the execution of the first loop, and is usually used to create a counter. The condition is the expression being checked each time before the loop runs. If it evaluates to true, the statement or code in the loop is executed. If it evaluates to false, the loop stops. And if this expression is omitted, it automatically evaluates to true. Lastly, the final expression is the expression expression being executed after each iteration of the loop. This is usually used to increment a counter, but can be used to decrement a counter instead.</p>

        <h2><a id="the-dom-shortcut">The DOM</a></h2>
        <p>The DOM (short for the Document Object Model) is the glue that ties everything together. It is used to show the collision of HTML, CSS and JavaScript working together to create what gets shown.</p>
        <p>Webpages can be displayed in HTML or the browser window, however the DOM allows it to be manipulated with languages such as JavaScript.</p>
        <p>The DOM is a programming interface for web documents which represents the page so that programs can change the documents structure, style and/or content. The DOM is not a programming language, however without it, JavaScript would not have any model or notion of webpages, HTML or other component parts.</p>
        <p>Everything that makes up the DOM is generally known as nodes, including elements, attributes, text content and comments, among other things, which allows programming languages to interact with the page and make changes with scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
        <p>The DOM is not part of the JavaScript language, but is a Web API used to build websites. The DOM was not designed to be independent to any particular programming language, and can thus be built for any language, such as Python.</p>

        <h2><a id="arrays-and-objects-shortcut">Arrays and Objects</a></h2>
        <p>It is common to use objects when we are trying to represent a 'thing' in JavaScript, whether that be a person, a car or a robot. For example, objects would be used to track makes, models and years of cars that a garage yard is selling. We can access data from objects by using dot notation to write the name of the object and accessing the key that we are after.</p>
        <p>We use arrays whenever we want to create and store a list of multiple items in a single variable. For example, a list of names attending a birthday party. On the other hand, we can access data from arrays by using indexing (the list starts at index 0 and increases by 1 as you move to the next element in the list).</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2><a id="functions-shortcut">What are functions?</a></h2>
        <p>Functions are a fundamental part of coding with JavaScript as they are used to perform any task that you would like it to or to calculate a value. Functions can also take parameters by values to return an outcome. For example functions can be used to calculate the square of a number by simply writing number * number inside the function and console logging the outcome.</p>
