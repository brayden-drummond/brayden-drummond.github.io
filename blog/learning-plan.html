      <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>

      <div>
        <h2>What is my long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>My career pathway plan is to get into software development/engineering upon completion at Dev Academy. I am heavily interested in learning about game development and my long term goal is to develop my skills to become a game developer one day. However, I need to develop the basic coding skills first.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div>
        <h2>A description of my strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h2>
        <p>My strentgths when it comes to learning includes my motivation and goal-orientated mind-set. I am heavily motivated in learning new material and developing my career. I am kept motivated as I want to be in a career in the near future where I am contributing to the development of tech and Te Ao Maori.</p>
        <p>I am heavily goal orientated and am always looking for the next opportunity, my next steps in temrs of the goals I am trying to achieve and the best way to go about achieving this. Examples include completing my law degree and professional legal studies, and developing my te reo outside of study or working hours.</p>
        <p>In terms of limitations, sometimes I become stressed when there are multiple issues to solve at once. I find it hard to develop a healthy work/study-life balance which has led to stress before. I am trying to realistically think aboiut the amount of time I should be dedicating to my development and practise efficient and effective time-management skills to help mitigate the stress I sometimes feel.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would I like to see developed in myself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
        <p>I would like to develop strong resillience skills so that I can better manage stress while I am working under pressure. I would also like to develop stronger communication and collaboration skills as I am a naturally quiet person.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <h2>A commitment to how I will manage my workload in this programme.</h2>
        <p>I am reasonably good at managing myself to work productively and to deadlines. I developed these skills while at University and working from home with my last job. For myself, I like to set myself a goal to complete a certain amount of work per day, however I do want to develop stronger time management skills as sometimes I may work a bit longer than expected to achieve this.</p>
        <p>I will work safely with others by not taking any feedback negatively. I am mindful that everyone is trying to help me achieve my goals here and any feedback on how I can improve is to be treated positively. I will make sure to continue to be kind to others also.</p>
        <p>When things are building up and starting to get to me, I find it best to take a step back and have a breather. This usually helps me refocus my mind and I feel I am more switched on after taking shorter breaks. If I am having any issues, I will make sure to discuss this with other learners or my facilitator. This applies to when I am stuck on an issue. If I am unable to solve the problem within the timebox suggestions, I will make sure to seek help from other learners or my facilitator.</p>
        <p>I have enjoyed working with the facilitation team up to this point. I am really thankful for their helpful pointers and timely responses to any issues I have had so far. I appreciate that the facilitators are doing what they can to help me develop my skills and I know this will continue moving forward.</p>
        <p>I have no scheduling information to report at this point in time, but if any developments occur, I will make sure to let one of the facilitators know.</p>
