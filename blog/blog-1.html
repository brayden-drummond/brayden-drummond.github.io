    <h1>The Difference Between Margin, Border and Padding</h1>

      <h2><a id="The-CSS-Box-Model">The CSS Box Model</a></h2>
      <p>The CSS box model helps us understand the differences between padding, border and margin. The term "box model" is used when talking 
      about design and layout in CSS. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element and consists of margins, borders, padding, and 
      the actual content. It  allows us to add a border around elements and  define space between elements. The image below illustrates the box model:</p>

      <p>I personally found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIO5326FgPE">this video</a> extremely helpful when trying to learn what the CSS box model is.
      If you haven't already, I highly recommend watching it.</p>

    <div>
      <h2><a id="Content">So what is Content?</a></h2>
      <p>The <b>content box</b> contains the "real" content of the element, such as text, an image, or a video. Everything created 
     in HTML is essentially a box. The dimensions are defined by the content width and the content height and often has a background colour or background image. 
     When writing text in HTML, this colour will automatically be white.</p>
      <p>If the box-sizing property is set to content-box (default) and the element is a block element, the content area's size can be explicity defined with 
      the width, min-width, max-width, height, min-height, and max-height properties.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2><a id="Padding">What about Padding?</a></h2>
      <p>The <b>padding area</b> is the space between the content and the edge of the box (to border). It clears an area around the content 
      and is affected by the background colour of the box. Its dimensions are defined by <em>padding-box width</em> and the <em>padding-box height</em>.</p>
      <p>The thickness of the padding is determined by the padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom and padding-left properties.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2><a id="Border">What is Border?</a></h2>
      <p>The <b>border area</b> extends the padding area to include the element's borders, it is essentially the outside edge of the box. It is a border that goes around the 
      padding and content and is affected by the background colour of the box. Its dimensions are the <em>border-box width</em> and the <em>border-box height</em>.</p>
      <p>The thickness ofd the borders is determined by the border-width property. If the box-sizing property is set to border-box, then the border area's 
        size can be defined with the width, min-width, max-width, height, min-height, and max-height properties. When there is a background colour or image set
        on a box, it extends to the outer edge of the border.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2><a id="Margin">Lastly, what is Margin?</a></h2>
      <p>The <b>margin area</b> extends the border area to include an empty area used to separate an element from its neighbours (other content or boxes). It is the 
      empty area around the border and is completely transparent, it has no background cgit pusolour by default. Its dimensions are the <em>margin-box width</em> and the <em>
      margin-box height</em>.</p>
      <p>The size of the margin area is determined by the margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom and margin-left properties. </p>
