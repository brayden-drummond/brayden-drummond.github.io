        <h2>Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h2>
        <p>
          Before discussing how neuroplasticity benefits people, we first need to know neuroplasticity is. Put simply, neuroplasticity is the idea that the brain has the ability to be modified, changed, and even adapt throughout our lives and any experiences we encounter. Shaw and McEachern write that there are two main perspectives on neuroplasticity:
        </p>
        <ul class="neuroplasticity-list">
          <li>Neuroplasticity is one fundamental process that describes any change in final neural activity or behavioral response, or;</li>
          <li>Neuroplasticity is an umbrella term for a vast collection of different brain change and adaptation phenomena.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The theory of neuroplasticity is a developing subject, and what we know for certain is that there are two main types of neuroplasticity:
        </p>
        <ul class="neuroplasticity-list">
          <li>Structural neuroplasticity, in which the strength of the connections between neurons (or synapses) changes.</li>
          <li>Functional neuroplasticity, which describes the permanent changes in synapses due to learning and development (Demarin, Morović, & Béne, 2014).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Now having a basic understanding of neuroplasticity, you may be wondering 'well how does neuroplasticity benefit people?' There are many benefits to neuroplasticity, and studies have shown that neuroplasticity can, among other things: help with depression; allow your brain to recover from traumatic events (such as a stroke); provides for enhanced memory abilities; and provide for more effective and targeted learning.
        </p>
        <h2>How will I engage with the principles of neuroplasticity?</h2>
        <p>
          By understanding what neuroplasticity is and it's benefits that it has on an indivvidual, why would you not want to engage with it? I will engage with the principles of neuroplasticity by continuing to develop my knowledge and awareness of neuroplasticity, and importantly, practice constant repitition to ensure that I am excelling in my study of programming.
        </p>
        <h2>What are some ways to increase neuroplasticity?</h2>
        <p>
          There are many ways to increase neuroplasticity, however the two key methods are:
        </p>
        <ul class="neuroplasticity-list">
          <li>Task repitition; and</li>
          <li>Task-specific practice.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In other words, learning a new skill or activity through specific, regular practice can result in significant changes in the brain.

          While researching the principles of neuroplasticity, I found this link extremely helpful as it clear set out what the principles are, and the positive impacts of understanding these principles has on an individuals livelihood and well-being: <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/neuroplasticity/#theory-neuroplasticity">What is Neuroplasticity?

        <h2>What does it mean to have a Growth Mindset?</h2>
        <p>
          You are not automatically born with a growth mindset, and this can be developed. To sum up what a growth mindset is, it means that an individual believes taht their talents can be developed through hardwork, good strategies, and input from others. People who have a growth mindset tend to achieve more than those with a fixed mindset (that individuals are born with their talents and skills). I know for a fact that when I was researching into this subject, I was surpirsed at the amount of scientific research and evidence which backs up this statement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you are looking to start a new career, learn a new instrument, or develop a skill, it is important to have a growth mindset (that your skills will be developed through practice and repitition).
        </p>
        <h2>How will I integrate a growth mindset into my learning journey?</h2>
        <p>
          I will integrate a growth mindset into my learning journey of programming by understanding that the more practice and repitition I spend on certain tasks, the stronger I will be at doing these tasks in the future. Although I may not understand or get the correct solution at the time, I know that my skills are constantly developing.

          I personally found this link helpful in understanding what having a growth mindset means: <a href="https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/">Decades of Scientific Research that Started a Growth Mindset Revolution</a>
        </p>
        <h2>How these understandings will shape or influence my learning plan?</h2>
        <p>
          The understandings of neuroplasticity and growth mindset will shape or influence my learning plan as I will learn to be patient with myself when trying to understand core or technical concepts in the world of programming. Understanding that the brain is always developing is a positive train of thought as even though I may not have the correct solution at the time, effort, practice and repitition is always rewarded.
