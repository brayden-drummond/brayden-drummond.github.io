        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>In essence, emotional intelligfence is "the ability to monitor ones own and others feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions.” - Salovey and Mayer 1990</p>
          
        <p>There are 3 steps to emotional intelligence, being mindfulness, self knowledge and mastery and creating useful mental habits.</p>
          
        <p>Mindfulness practice improves attention, cultivates a greater sense of compassion for ouseleves and others, and can teach us to be less reactive.</p>
          
        <p>Self-knowledge and self-mastery allows us to understand what is happening internally when we engage in a particular situation.</p>
          
        <p>Creating useful mental habits allows us to train our minds to develop habits to defend against self-critical thinking and judgement.</p>
          
        <p>There are three primary strengths to increasing our emotional intelligence, being stellar performance, outstanding leadership and happiness.</p>
          
        <p>Studies have shown that the higher up the ladder one goes in their work environment display a higher level of EQ, rather than IQ.</p>
          
        <p>“For those in leadership positions, emotional intelligence skills account for close to 90 per cent of what distinguishes outstanding leaders from those judged as average.” Kemper 1999</p>
          
        <p>Emotional intelligence is a collection of skills. It is not something that we are born with, rather it is a skill that we can develop through practice and discipline.</p>
          
        <p>There are 3 ways we can practice EQ, being mindfulness, conscious listening and journaling.</p>
          
        <p>Mindfulness is a form of meditation, and "is the awareness that emerges through paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally to things as they are. ~ Jon Kabat-Zinn</p>
          
        <p>Mindfulness helps us to cultivate focus and atention which is helpful in all parts of our lives. The goal isnt solely about achieving a alm, clear and alert mind, rather it is notice, without judgement, whatever is here in each present moment. The key aspect of being attentive to our experience is to do so non-judgementally (without crticism, judgements, or evaluations).</p>
          
        <p>Conscious listening is beneficial as it allows us to absorb information whilst allowing the other person to feel met and heard. The person listening should be able to loop back (relayt) the key parts to the person who was speaking to display their attentive listening. If there are any distinctions while the person is relaying the information, this can be clarified or changed during this time.</p>
          
        <p>It can also be good to note what it is you thought the other person was feeling back to them.</p>
          
        <p>Journaling is essentially a brain dump, self-discovery and private and prompts what we are feeling in the moment, how we feel when we are understood and what we care about. When we are writing, the primary rule is to not stop as it develops our brains greater awareness of the benefits of stressful events. Journaling allows us to process the stressful event (it is the same as talking to a best friend about a break-up).</p>

        <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
        <p>IQ is used to determine academic ability and identify ones ability to solve problems, use logic, and grasp or communicate ideas. On the other hand EQ measures a persons ability to recognise emotion in ourselves and others, and to use our awareness to guide decision-making. EQ is a better indicator of success in the workplace and is used to identify leaders, good team players, and people who best work by themselves.</p>

        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
        <p>EQ is important as it is a better indicator of success in the workplace and is used to identify leaders, good team players, and people who best work by themselves.</p>
        <p>Practising EQ skills is highly bebneficial for many reasons, including improving our attention and teaching ourselves to become less reactive, training our brain to negate self-critical judgement, and to process any trauma and how we deal in stressful events.</p>
        <p>"A high IQ will get you through school, a high EQ will get you through life."</p>
